# What is Addition?

Addition is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, along with subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is the process of combining two or more numbers to get a total or sum.

## How Addition Works

When you add numbers together, you are essentially counting how many items you have in total. For example:

- 2 + 3 = 5
- 10 + 15 = 25
- 100 + 200 = 300

## Properties of Addition

1. **Commutative Property**: The order of numbers doesn't matter
   - 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 = 8

2. **Associative Property**: The grouping of numbers doesn't matter
   - (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9

3. **Identity Property**: Adding zero to any number gives the same number
   - 5 + 0 = 5
