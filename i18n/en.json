          "paragraph1": "Addition is one of the four fundamental arithmetic operations in mathematics. It is the process of combining two or more numbers (called addends) to produce a single number known as the sum or total. Addition is represented by the plus sign (+) and is the most basic operation taught in elementary mathematics. Whether you're working with whole numbers, decimals, fractions, or negative numbers, addition follows the same principle: combining quantities to find their total value.",
          "paragraph2": "To add two numbers, simply enter the first number (a) and the second number (b) into the calculator. The calculator will instantly compute the sum (a + b). Addition is commutative, meaning the order of the numbers doesn't matter: a + b = b + a. For example, 5 + 3 = 8 and 3 + 5 = 8. Addition is also associative, meaning when adding three or more numbers, the grouping doesn't matter: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).",
          "paragraph3": "Our calculator automatically performs addition using the standard mathematical operation. It handles positive numbers, negative numbers, decimals, and very large numbers with high precision. Whether you're working on homework, solving math problems, calculating totals in real-world scenarios, or performing calculations in various fields, our addition calculator provides accurate, instant solutions.",
          "exampleHeading": "Example:",
          "exampleText": "If you enter 5 and 3, the result is 5 + 3 = 8. If you enter 12.5 and 7.3, the result is 12.5 + 7.3 = 19.8. If you enter -10 and 15, the result is -10 + 15 = 5. For any two numbers a and b, the calculator computes a + b accurately."

              "question": "What is the formula to convert kW to kVA?",
              "answer": "The formula is kVA = kW / PF, where kVA is apparent power in kilovolt-amperes, kW is real power in kilowatts, and PF is the power factor (0 to 1). Real power equals apparent power times power factor, so apparent power is real power divided by power factor."

              "question": "What is the difference between kW and kVA?",
              "answer": "kW (kilowatts) is real power—the actual work done by the load (e.g. mechanical output, heat, light). kVA (kilovolt-amperes) is apparent power—the total power delivered by the source, including reactive power that does not do useful work. kVA ≥ kW always; they are equal only when power factor is 1.0 (purely resistive load)."
            },
            {
              "question": "What is power factor and what values are typical?",
              "answer": "Power factor (PF) is the ratio kW / kVA, ranging from 0 to 1. It measures how efficiently electrical power is converted to useful work. Typical values: resistive heaters ~1.0, fluorescent lights 0.5–0.95, induction motors 0.7–0.9, power supplies 0.6–0.95. Lower PF means higher kVA is required for the same kW, increasing conductor and transformer size."

            {
              "question": "Why do I need to convert kW to kVA?",
              "answer": "Transformers, generators, UPS units, and circuit breakers are rated in kVA, not kW. A load drawing 10 kW at PF 0.8 requires 12.5 kVA of supply capacity. Sizing equipment by kW alone (ignoring PF) can lead to overload. Converting kW to kVA ensures you select equipment with sufficient apparent power capacity."

          "paragraph1": "Converting electron-volts (eV) to volts (V) is a fundamental conversion in physics, particularly in particle physics, atomic physics, and electronics. An electron-volt is a unit of energy equal to the amount of kinetic energy gained by a single electron when it accelerates through an electric potential difference of one volt. This makes the conversion straightforward: 1 eV = 1 V for a single electron. Our free Electron-volts to Volts conversion calculator makes this process quick and easy, providing instant and accurate results for your physics calculations.",
          "paragraph2": "The conversion formula is: V = eV, where V is the voltage in volts and eV is the energy in electron-volts. This direct 1:1 relationship exists because the electron-volt is defined as the energy gained by an electron when it moves through a potential difference of one volt. The electron-volt is a convenient unit for expressing energies on the atomic and subatomic scale, commonly used in particle physics, atomic physics, and semiconductor physics.",
          "paragraph3": "This conversion is commonly used in various applications: particle accelerator physics, semiconductor device physics, atomic and molecular physics, X-ray and gamma-ray energy measurements, electron microscopy, plasma physics, and quantum mechanics calculations. Understanding the relationship between electron-volts and volts helps physicists, engineers, and researchers work with energy scales from atomic transitions to high-energy particle collisions.",
