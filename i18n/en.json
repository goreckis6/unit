              "question": "What is the formula to convert watts to kVA?",
              "answer": "The formula to convert watts (W) to kilovolt-amperes (kVA) is: kVA = W / (1000 × PF), where W is the power in watts, PF is the power factor (a value between 0 and 1), and kVA is the apparent power in kilovolt-amperes."

            {
              "question": "What is power factor?",
              "answer": "Power factor (PF) is the ratio of real power (watts) to apparent power (kVA). It indicates how efficiently electrical power is being used. A power factor of 1.0 (or 100%) means all the power is being used effectively, while lower values indicate that some power is being wasted."

            {
              "question": "What is a typical power factor value?",
              "answer": "Typical power factor values range from 0.8 to 1.0. Most electrical systems have a power factor between 0.85 and 0.95. Residential loads typically have a power factor around 0.9, while industrial loads may have lower power factors."

              "question": "Is this calculator free to use?",
              "answer": "Yes, our watts to kVA calculator is completely free to use. No registration or payment is required. Simply enter your values and get instant, accurate results."
